Write a Python program to change a given string to a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged

Answer:
def change(str):
 first_character = str[0]
 last_character = str[-1]
 middle_characters = str[1:-1]
 return last_character + middle_characters + first_character

print(change(str))

NB: str = string input
