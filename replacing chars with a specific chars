Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '@', except the first char itself.

def change_chars(str):
 first_character = str[0]
 str = str.replace( first_character, "@")
 str = first_character + str[1:]
 return str

print(change_chars("EssElE"))
